# Reusable Prompts for Giant Swarm SREs & GitHub Copilot

This file contains a collection of reusable prompts to help Giant Swarm SREs interact more effectively with the GitHub Copilot AI assistant. Remember to replace placeholders like `<cluster_id>`, `<namespace>`, `<pod_name>`, etc., with actual values. These are starting points; feel free to adapt and expand on them.

## Cluster Health & Status

### Check Workload Cluster Health
**Scenario**: A workload cluster appears to be having general issues or unresponsiveness.
**Prompt**:
"My workload cluster `<cluster_id>` (provider: `<aws/azure/vsphere/capa/capz>`) on management cluster `<mc_id>` seems unhealthy. Can you suggest initial diagnostic steps using `kubectl` (on MC and WC if accessible) and `kubectl gs` to check its overall status, CAPI conditions, node health, and critical control plane components in the WC?"

### Investigate Node NotReady Status
**Scenario**: One or more nodes in a workload cluster are reporting NotReady status.
**Prompt**:
"Node `<node_name>` in workload cluster `<cluster_id>` is in a `NotReady` state. What are the common causes and what `kubectl describe node <node_name>`, `kubectl logs <kubelet_pod_on_node>` (if possible), and other checks should I perform on both the MC (for CAPI machine status) and WC?"

## Workload Cluster Provisioning/Management

### Template a New Workload Cluster
**Scenario**: Need to generate the YAML for a new workload cluster.
**Prompt**:
"I need to template a new workload cluster using `kubectl gs template cluster`.
Provider: `<capa/capz/capv/etc.>`
Cluster Name: `<my_cluster_name>`
Organization: `<my_org_name>`
Release Version: `<specific_release_version_X.Y.Z>`
Target Namespace on MC (if different from org): `org-<my_org_name>`

What is the full `kubectl gs template cluster` command I should use, and what are the key CRDs that will be generated in the output YAML?"

### Troubleshoot Cluster Creation Failure
**Scenario**: A workload cluster creation is stuck or has failed.
**Prompt**:
"Workload cluster `<cluster_id>` (provider: `<provider>`) creation on MC `<mc_id>` has failed or is stuck. How do I investigate this? What CAPI objects on the MC should I inspect (e.g., `Cluster`, `AWSCluster`, `Machine`, `KubeadmControlPlane`) and what conditions or events should I look for?"

## Application Deployment & Debugging

### Debug Failing Application Deployment
**Scenario**: An application deployed via an App CR is not running correctly.
**Prompt**:
"The application `<app_name>` (version `<app_version>`) deployed via an `App` CR in namespace `org-<org_name>` on MC `<mc_id>`, targeting namespace `<target_namespace>` in workload cluster `<cluster_id>`, is failing.
How can I check:
1. The status of the `App` CR on the MC?
2. The status of the corresponding `Release` CR on the MC?
3. The Helm release status within the WC?
4. The status of pods, services, and related ConfigMaps/Secrets for this app in the `<target_namespace>` of WC `<cluster_id>`?"

### Check App Configuration
**Scenario**: Need to verify the configuration applied to a deployed application.
**Prompt**:
"How can I view the user-provided values (`userConfig`) and the final merged values for the deployed app `<app_name>` in namespace `<target_namespace>` on workload cluster `<cluster_id>` (managed by `App` CR `<app_name>` in `org-<org_name>` on MC `<mc_id>`)?"

## Network Troubleshooting (Cilium)

### Basic Pod Connectivity Check
**Scenario**: Pods within a namespace are unable to communicate with each other or with services.
**Prompt**:
"Pods in namespace `<namespace>` on workload cluster `<cluster_id>` are having connectivity issues. The CNI is Cilium. What are the initial steps to debug this, including:
1. Checking pod statuses and IPs.
2. Verifying service endpoints.
3. Inspecting NetworkPolicies.
4. Checking Cilium agent status and logs (`ds/cilium` in `kube-system`)."

### Troubleshoot Cilium ENI Mode on AWS
**Scenario**: Specific issues related to Cilium ENI mode on an AWS workload cluster.
**Prompt**:
"Workload cluster `<cluster_id>` on AWS is using Cilium ENI mode. Pods in namespace `<namespace>` are having trouble communicating externally (or with other VPC resources). What AWS-specific aspects should I check in conjunction with Cilium, such as:
1. EC2 instance ENI limits and allocations.
2. Security Groups associated with nodes and pods.
3. VPC route tables.
4. Cilium configuration related to ENIs (`global.connectivity.cilium.ipamMode`, `global.connectivity.network.pods.cidrBlocks`)."

## Log Analysis (Loki/Promtail)

### Construct Basic LogQL Query
**Scenario**: Need to find specific logs in Loki.
**Prompt**:
"I need to find all error logs from pods with the label `app.kubernetes.io/name=<my_app_label>` in namespace `<namespace>` on workload cluster `<cluster_id>` within the last hour. Can you help me construct a LogQL query for this? Assume standard Kubernetes labels are present in logs."

### Check Promtail Status
**Scenario**: Logs are not appearing in Loki for a specific cluster or application.
**Prompt**:
"Logs from workload cluster `<cluster_id>` (or specifically from app `<app_name>` in namespace `<namespace>`) don't seem to be reaching Loki. How can I check the status and logs of Promtail pods on that workload cluster to see if they are running correctly and scraping targets?"

## `kubectl gs` Assistance

### Login to Workload Cluster
**Scenario**: Need the command to log in to a workload cluster.
**Prompt**:
"What is the `kubectl gs login` command to access workload cluster `<cluster_id>` which is managed by management cluster `<mc_id>`? What are common flags I might need, like specifying a specific context or internal API?"

## Interacting with MCP Tools (Conceptual)

### Inquire about MCP Tool for a Task
**Scenario**: SRE has a complex debugging task and wonders if a specialized MCP tool could help.
**Prompt**:
"I need to get detailed information about active network connections on node `<node_name>` in workload cluster `<cluster_id>`, beyond what `netstat` or `ss` on the node might show. Is this a scenario where an MCP tool (via `envctl`) might be useful, if one exists for deep network inspection? If so, how would I generally ask an MCP-aware agent about such a tool?"
